# Password Policy Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of comprehensive password policies in the application.

## Overview

The password policy system ensures that users maintain strong, secure passwords and regularly update them to enhance security. The implementation includes password strength requirements, password expiration, password history tracking, and a user interface for managing passwords.

## Features Implemented

- [x] Password strength requirements
  - Minimum length of 12 characters
  - Must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
  - Rejection of common passwords
  - Prevention of personal information in passwords

- [x] Password expiration
  - Passwords expire after 90 days
  - Warning notifications starting 14 days before expiration
  - Grace period for login after expiration
  - Forced password change after expiration

- [x] Password history
  - Remembers the last 5 passwords
  - Prevents reuse of recent passwords
  - Minimum password age to prevent rapid cycling

- [x] User interface
  - Password strength meter
  - Password expiration warnings
  - Dedicated password change page
  - Security settings page

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

1. **User Model**:
   - Added `passwordLastChanged` field to track when the password was last changed
   - Added `passwordExpiresAt` field to track when the password will expire
   - Added `previousPasswords` field to store hashed previous passwords
   - Added `passwordChangeRequired` field to force password change on next login

2. **Migrations**:
   - Created migration script to add new fields to the User model
   - Created script to update existing users with appropriate values

### Backend Implementation

1. **Password Policy Service**:
   - Created a dedicated service for password policy enforcement
   - Implemented password strength validation
   - Implemented password history checking
   - Implemented password expiration management

2. **Middleware**:
   - Created middleware to check password expiration status
   - Applied middleware to protected routes
   - Added grace period for expired passwords

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Added endpoint for changing passwords
   - Added endpoint for checking password status
   - Enhanced password reset functionality

4. **Security Logging**:
   - Added logging for password-related security events
   - Tracked password changes, expirations, and policy violations

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Components**:
   - Created password strength meter component
   - Created password expiration warning banner
   - Created password change form
   - Enhanced security settings page

2. **Pages**:
   - Added dedicated password change page
   - Added security settings page
   - Updated profile sidebar with security links

3. **Integration**:
   - Added password expiration banner to dashboard and profile layouts
   - Integrated password strength meter with registration and password change forms

## Configuration

Password policies are configurable through the `passwordPolicyConfig` object in `packages/api/src/config/password-policy.config.ts`. The following settings can be adjusted:

- Password strength requirements
- Password expiration period
- Number of previous passwords to remember
- Minimum password age
- Account lockout settings
- Password reset settings

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**:
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a cost factor of 12
   - Previous passwords are stored as hashed values
   - Plain text passwords are never stored or logged

2. **Token Security**:
   - Password reset tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Tokens are single-use and invalidated after use
   - Tokens are securely generated using cryptographically secure methods

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Password change and reset endpoints are rate-limited
   - Progressive rate limiting increases lockout duration after multiple failures

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add password dictionary check to reject commonly used passwords
- [ ] Implement password similarity check to prevent minor variations of previous passwords
- [ ] Add configurable password complexity requirements based on user role
- [ ] Implement password breach checking against known data breaches
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication as an additional security layer
