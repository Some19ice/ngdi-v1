# Comprehensive Review Implementation Tracking

This document tracks the progress of implementing recommendations from the comprehensive code review.

## API Recommendations

| ID | Recommendation | Status | Implementation Details |
|----|---------------|--------|------------------------|
| API-01 | Eliminate duplicate router files | âœ… Completed | Removed duplicate router files and consolidated implementations. Specifically removed `routes/index.ts` and used the newer versions of `user.routes.ts` and `metadata.routes.ts`. |
| API-02 | Standardize route registration and middleware application | âœ… Completed | Updated main `index.ts` file to use consistent router imports and middleware application. |
| API-03 | Ensure consistent response formats across all endpoints | âœ… Completed | Implemented centralized error handling service that ensures consistent response format for errors. |
| API-04 | Standardize error handling and logging | âœ… Completed | Created `error-handling.service.ts` to provide consistent error handling and logging across the API. Updated route handlers to use this service. |
| API-05 | Improve security by implementing proper error handling | âœ… Completed | Enhanced error handling to prevent leaking sensitive information in production. |
| API-06 | Unify database schema | ðŸ”„ In Progress | - |
| API-07 | Resolve circular dependencies | ðŸ”„ In Progress | - |

## Next Steps

The following tasks are prioritized for the next implementation phase:

1. Update remaining route handlers to use the centralized error handling service
2. Remove remaining mock data implementations in the web package
3. Unify database schema to use a single source of truth
4. Resolve circular dependencies between packages
5. Implement CSRF protection and rate limiting for enhanced security
