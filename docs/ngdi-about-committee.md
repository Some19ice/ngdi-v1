# National Geo-Spatial Data Infrastructure (NGDI)

## About NGDI

### Introduction
The National Geo-Spatial Data Infrastructure (NGDI) is a strategic initiative aimed at creating a unified framework for geospatial data production, management, sharing, and utilization in Nigeria. With geospatial information underpinning approximately 80% of planning and decision-making processes, the NGDI addresses the need for accurate, accessible, and interoperable geospatial datasets across all sectors of the economy. NGDI seeks to resolve long-standing challenges such as data duplication, lack of standardization, and limited accessibility, thereby enhancing national development through evidence-based decisions.

### Vision
To optimize the use of geospatial data as a critical resource for sustainable development and efficient service delivery.

### Mission
To establish institutional, legal, technical, and administrative frameworks for coordinating the Production, sharing, and dissemination of standardized geospatial data across all levels of governance in Nigeria.

### Objectives
The NGDI aims to:
1. Facilitate collaboration among geospatial data producers, managers, and users.
2. Promote standardized data collection and dissemination mechanisms.
3. Eliminate duplication in data acquisition and maintenance, improving cost-efficiency.
4. Ensure the availability of core datasets to support national planning, disaster management, and
5. Economic growth.
6. Build capacity and promote research in geospatial technologies.
7. Encourage indigenous innovation in geospatial applications.

### Core Components
1. **Governance**
   - A National NGDI Council chaired by the Vice President of Nigeria provides strategic oversight.
   - The Council is supported by a multidisciplinary NGDI Committee comprising representatives from federal ministries, private sectors, academia, and NGOs.
   - NASRDA serves as the coordinating agency, ensuring policy implementation and stakeholder engagement.

2. **Data Standards and Interoperability**
   - Adoption of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards to ensure data compatibility across systems.
   - Development of national geospatial data guidelines for data collection, storage, and sharing.

3. **Metadata and Clearinghouse Services**
   - Establishment of metadata catalogs and clearing houses to enable data discoverability and easy access.
   - Regular updates to metadata to maintain data relevance and usability.

4. **Open Access and Data Security**
   - Open access policies for non-restricted datasets to encourage innovation.
   - Secure systems to protect classified data and ensure intellectual property rights compliance.

5. **Fundamental Datasets**
   - Creation and maintenance of core geospatial datasets, including:
     - Administrative boundaries
     - Topography and elevation
     - Land use and land cover
     - Population distribution
     - Transportation networks
     - Environmental data

6. **Capacity Building and Public Awareness**
   - Training programs to equip stakeholders with skills in geospatial data production and analysis.
   - Public awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of geospatial data in daily life.
