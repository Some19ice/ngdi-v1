## Notes and Decisions

- Decision to use Supabase Auth exclusively for authentication
- Decision to maintain existing security features like CSRF protection and rate limiting
- Decision to use HTTP-only cookies for token storage instead of localStorage

## Next Steps

1. Assign team members to tasks
2. Set up project timeline
3. Begin preparation phase with code audit and mapping
