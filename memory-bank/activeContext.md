# Active Context: NGDI Portal

## Current Work Focus
Based on our comprehensive project review, we are now focusing on:

1. **Documentation Improvement**: Developing detailed documentation for the NGDI Portal, including the Memory Bank for project context and technical specifications.

2. **Feature Assessment**: Analyzing the implementation status of key features (authentication, metadata management, map visualization, search) to identify areas that need refinement.

3. **Code Quality**: Evaluating code quality and identifying potential optimization opportunities, particularly in performance-critical areas like search and map visualization.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Reviewing the testing framework and developing a plan for comprehensive test coverage.

## Recent Changes
Based on the codebase exploration and timestamp analysis, recent changes include:

1. **Authentication Enhancements**: Improvements to the login form and session management (components/auth/login-form.tsx updated recently).

2. **Metadata Management**: Updates to metadata search and results components (components/metadata/search-form.tsx and results.tsx).

3. **Admin Functionality**: Enhancements to admin components and routes (components/admin/ and packages/api/src/routes/admin.routes.ts).

4. **Database Schema**: Updates to the Prisma schema for the metadata model (prisma/schema.prisma).

5. **Memory Bank Development**: Creation and enhancement of the Memory Bank documentation structure.

## Next Steps

1. **Code Quality Assessment**:
   - Review critical components for performance optimization
   - Identify and address potential security issues
   - Assess code maintainability and documentation

2. **Testing Enhancement**:
   - Develop additional test cases for critical functionality
   - Implement end-to-end tests for key user workflows
   - Set up regular test execution in the development workflow

3. **Feature Refinement**:
   - Optimize metadata management for large datasets
   - Enhance search functionality with additional filters and sorting options
   - Improve map visualization with additional layers and controls

4. **Documentation Development**:
   - Complete Memory Bank documentation with detailed architecture and implementation notes
   - Develop user documentation for the portal
   - Create API documentation for developers

5. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Review deployment scripts and configuration
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Prepare for production deployment

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Architecture Refinement**: Based on our understanding of the codebase, we should consider:
   - Optimizing the data flow between frontend and backend
   - Improving state management strategies
   - Enhancing component reusability

2. **Performance Optimization**: Key areas for performance improvement include:
   - Metadata search and filtering for large datasets
   - Map visualization with complex geospatial data
   - Authentication and session management

3. **Code Organization**: While the codebase is well-organized, we should consider:
   - Further modularization of complex components
   - Shared utilities for common operations
   - Enhanced typing for better type safety

4. **Testing Strategy**: We need to establish a comprehensive testing strategy covering:
   - Unit tests for critical components and functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for key user workflows
   - Performance tests for critical features

5. **Documentation Strategy**: We should focus on developing:
   - Comprehensive Memory Bank documentation
   - User documentation for the portal
   - API documentation for developers
   - Component documentation for maintainers

## Current Questions

1. What are the specific performance requirements for the metadata search and map visualization features?

2. Are there specific accessibility requirements for the portal that need to be addressed?

3. What is the expected scale of the metadata database, and how should we optimize for it?

4. What are the specific security requirements for the portal, particularly for sensitive geospatial data?

5. Are there specific integration requirements with external systems or APIs?

6. What is the timeline for production deployment, and what are the critical features for the initial release?

7. What are the monitoring and logging requirements for the production environment?

8. What are the backup and disaster recovery requirements for the portal and its data?
