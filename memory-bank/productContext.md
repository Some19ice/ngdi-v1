# Product Context: NGDI Portal

## Why This Project Exists
The National Geospatial Data Infrastructure (NGDI) Portal exists to address the need for a centralized, accessible, and efficient system for managing Nigeria's geospatial data. Previously, geospatial data in Nigeria was likely scattered across various agencies and systems, making it difficult to access, share, and utilize effectively. This portal aims to solve these problems by creating a unified platform.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Data Fragmentation**: Consolidates geospatial data from various sources into a single platform
2. **Accessibility Barriers**: Provides easier access to geospatial data for stakeholders
3. **Metadata Management**: Offers tools to organize and manage metadata for geospatial datasets
4. **Data Visualization**: Enables users to visualize geospatial data through interactive maps
5. **User Management**: Implements role-based access control for different types of users
6. **Search Efficiency**: Delivers advanced search functionality to quickly find relevant data

## How It Should Work
The NGDI Portal should function as a comprehensive platform where:

1. **Users** can register, log in, and manage their profiles
2. **Data Providers** can upload geospatial data and manage their metadata
3. **Administrators** can manage users, roles, and system settings
4. **Visitors** can search for and access public geospatial data
5. **All Users** can visualize geospatial data through interactive maps

The workflow should be intuitive, with clear navigation paths for different user roles and tasks.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: The portal should be easy to navigate, with a clear information architecture
2. **Responsive Design**: The interface should work well on different devices and screen sizes
3. **Performance**: The system should respond quickly to user interactions and data requests
4. **Accessibility**: The portal should be accessible to users with different abilities
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery paths should be provided
6. **Guided Workflows**: Step-by-step guidance for complex tasks like metadata creation
7. **Interactive Maps**: Smooth and interactive map visualization experience
8. **Efficient Search**: Fast and accurate search results with filtering options

## Target Users
1. **Government Agencies**: Departments responsible for geospatial data management
2. **Data Providers**: Organizations that generate and share geospatial data
3. **Researchers**: Academic and research institutions using geospatial data
4. **Policy Makers**: Officials who need geospatial data for decision-making
5. **General Public**: Citizens interested in accessing public geospatial information
6. **System Administrators**: Technical staff managing the portal
